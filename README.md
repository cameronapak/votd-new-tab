# Chrome New Tab - Verse of the Day

> [!important]
> This repo is old and when I was a very young engineer. Please feel free to use this and do what you want with it. However, the public YouVersion API does not exist anymore. I recommend using the [Bible Scraper API](https://faith.tools/app/343-biblescraper-api) or the [Free Use Bible API](https://bible.helloao.org/docs/?ref=faith.tools) 

This project is a Google Chrome extension that overrides each new tab with a beautifully displayed bible verse of the day. Verse provided by [YouVersion](https://developers.youversion.com/). Image provided by Unsplash.
